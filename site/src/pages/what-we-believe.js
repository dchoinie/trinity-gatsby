This this end Christ has instituted the Office of the Ministry and sends pastors to preach and administer the holy sacraments in His stead and name (John 6:63; 16:12-15; Luke 24:47; Matthew 28:19; John 20:21-23; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26).",

The word of forgiveness in Holy Absolution is to be heard as Christ our dear Lord speaking to us Himself (Luke 10:16).",
